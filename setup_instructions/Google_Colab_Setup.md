# Google Colab Setup for ML & Deep Learning

This repository provides the setup and steps to run Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

Before running the training code on Google Colab, you need:

1. A Google account to access Google Colab.
2. Basic understanding of Python and ML/DL concepts.
3. A dataset (either upload to Google Drive or use publicly available datasets).

## Setting Up Google Colab for ML/DL

### 1. Open Google Colab
- Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
- You can start a new notebook by clicking on **File > New notebook**.

### 2. Set up the Runtime
Google Colab provides free access to a GPU for running deep learning models.

- Go to **Runtime > Change runtime type**.
- Select **GPU** or **TPU** depending on your requirements. GPU is typically sufficient for most ML and DL tasks.
- For TPU, you can select that if your model specifically benefits from tensor processing units.



### 3. Mount Google Drive
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### 4. Install Required Libraries

Colab already has several machine learning libraries pre-installed. However, you may need to install additional packages depending on your project requirements.

For example:

```python
# Install necessary libraries
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install scikit-learn
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install pandas
!pip install seaborn
!pip install xgboost
```

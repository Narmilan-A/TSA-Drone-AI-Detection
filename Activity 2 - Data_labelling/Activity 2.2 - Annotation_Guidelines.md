# Annotation Guidelines

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the standardised annotation protocol.
- Apply consistent polygon labelling for vegetation types.
- Avoid common mistakes in annotation.

## Annotation Attributes Summary (Example Only)

| Class ID | Class Name         | Confidence Level (%) | Remarks                          |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1        | A       | 25, 50, 75, 100     | .....   |
| 2        | B      | 25, 50, 75, 100     | ....           |
| 3        | C      | 25, 50, 75, 100     | ....        |
| 4        | D           | 25, 50, 75, 100     | ....          |
| 5        | E           | 25, 50, 75, 100     | ....           |
| 6        | F | 100                 | ....   |

### Annotation Attribute: Confidence Level

Each annotated polygon should include an attribute called **Confidence_Level** indicating the annotator's confidence in the classification:

| Confidence Level | Description          |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 25%              | Low confidence       |
| 50%              | Moderate confidence  |
| 75%              | High confidence      |
| 100%             | Full confidence      |

### General Rules:
- We prefer most polygons to be labelled with **100% confidence**.  
- If your confidence is very low, please **do not label** the polygon.  
- Avoid labelling polygons that include **mixed pixels at the border**.  
- Ignore 1â€“2 pixels from the polygon edges and label only the middle area to avoid mixed pixel effects.
- Annotate **only clearly visible areas**.
- Avoid overlaps polygons.

## Step-by-Step
1. Open the drone orthomosaic.
2. Create a new vector layer for annotations.
3. Select the correct class before drawing each polygon.
4. Save your layer frequently.

ðŸ“Œ **Remember:** Follow the class definitions exactly for data consistency.
